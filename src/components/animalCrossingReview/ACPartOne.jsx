            <p><span>I</span> don't think there is much left to say about <em><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></em> that hasn't already been said, but if anything, I hope to express the pure delight and comfort this game has provided to many during the darkest year in recent history. The timing was perfect. Left to isolation in our homes, <em>Animal Crossing</em> offered a vacation to a world that is familiar enough to latch onto, but a whole heck of a lot sweeter. It's a game of cute capitalism, where you simulate daily life on an up-and-coming island pulling weeds, planting flowers, paving roads, and paying off an interest free loan to an ambitious tanuki, Tom Nook. Your island has modest beginnings, but soon 
            grows to a lively township as anthropomorphic animals get word of your island. 
            Most importantly, it gave an escape to the outdoors. 
            A crucial upgrade to the previous <em>Animal Crossing</em> games in the franchise is the ability to completely customize the island. 
            You're in charge of plotting where the citizens live and where the shops go. 
            Teraforming levels is a way to further express personal creativity and preference. 
            Every island is so unique and an extension of the crafter's world view which is why it was remarkle to visit each other's islands. 
            Visiting friends through <em><strong>ACNH</strong></em> helped me stay connected to people I couldn't visit, and even 
            led to reconnections of old friends. 
            Although the process to connect online is rather clunky and makes you jump through unnecessary hoops, 
            it didn't deter me completely from booking a flight on Dodo Airlines using my Nook Miles, the game's frequent flier mile program. 
            It's also worth noting the game recently added a new feature to the game allows the player to visit a random island who is not on your friends list if your friends are unavailable but you want to do some exploring for new island ideas. 
            The wide-spread appeal led to an array of Twitch streams, and other events hosted by celebrities such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/05/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-now-playing-animal-crossing-shes-visiting-her-followers/"><u>AOC</u></a>. 
            I remember people desperately trying to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch just to play this game which is a testimate to <em>Animal Crossing</em> itself, but also to how humans rely on others to persevere.
