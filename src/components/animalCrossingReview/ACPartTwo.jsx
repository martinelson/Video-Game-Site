            <p>In a moment where we needed each other the most, <em><strong>ACNH</strong></em> provided an outlet. 
            For that alone I will be forever grateful for what this game gave to me. 
            Eventually, I fell off from playing as I imagine the same with most players.
            All good things come to a close, and the game's strong appeal faded with time.
            However, there will always be free seasonal additions to the game, keeping things fresh for when you're ready to hop back online.
            Looking back at 2020, after we all have time to unpack the collective trauma we've experienced, we will find moments of joy in that hellish year.
            For me, I know one of them will be the time I've spent playing <em><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></em>.
